Please rate the following categories of the given piece of code on a scale of 1-100, where 1 is the lowest and 100 is the highest:

1. Readability: How easy is it to understand the code? Consider factors such as naming conventions, comments, and overall structure.

2. Efficiency: How well does the code perform in terms of time and space complexity? Consider factors such as algorithm choice, data structures used, and optimization techniques.

3. Maintainability: How easy is it to modify and extend the code? Consider factors such as modularity, adherence to design principles, and use of design patterns.

4. Robustness: How well does the code handle edge cases and unexpected inputs? Consider factors such as error handling, input validation, and fault tolerance.

5. Reusability: How easily can parts of the code be reused in other projects or contexts? Consider factors such as encapsulation, separation of concerns, and adherence to coding standards.
